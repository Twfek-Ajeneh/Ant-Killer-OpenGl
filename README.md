## Game Description

In the OpenGL Ant Killer Game, you find yourself inside your PC box, surrounded by crawling ants. Your goal is to exterminate every last ant and restore peace to your computer. But be cautious! Each time an ant reaches you, your health decreases. When your health reaches zero, it's game over.

To play the game, move your character within the confines of the PC box and aim your gun at the ants. Pull the trigger to fire and eliminate the pesky insects. Remember, accuracy and speed are key to achieving a high score.

The game mechanics ensure that you cannot pass through walls, glass, or any other components inside the PC. The collision detection system handles these interactions, maintaining a realistic and immersive experience.
